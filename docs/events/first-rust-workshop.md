# Spokane Rust Workshop: Building your first Rust application!

_May 9th, 2024 @ 6PM_ | [Find Spokane Rust on Meetup! :fontawesome-brands-meetup:](https://www.meetup.com/spokane-rust/)

## Prepare your laptops! We're running a Rust Workshop!

Are you interested in Rust but lacking the push or drive to get programming in it? Have you maybe tried before, but lacked guidance and help to create something? Then this is the event for you to attend!

Led by Spokane Rust organizers Joshua W. and Nathan T., join us while we guide you through the beginning steps of programming in Rust:

* Setting up your local development environment with Cargo and Rustup, so you can compile and run your applications.
* Adding a crate to your project so you can consume APIs others have created.
* Unit testing and some of the unexpectedly clever Rust idiosyncracies to do with it.
* Creating an application which you can interact with and debug.
* Delving first-hand into the complexities and nuance of Rust, such as working with the Borrow Checker.

For the content of this workshop, we'll begin with `cargo new` and end with a fully-functional command-line calculator. Our calculator will add, subtract, divide, multiply, and perhaps even handle parsing more complex lexical tokens! We'll learn how to gradually implement safety features and how to handle panics induced by buffer overflows and mismatching input at runtime.

This event is open to Rustaceans of all experience levels; never touched programming before? We'll help you get started! Experienced with another language and looking for assistance in translating higher level constructs into Rust's low-level form? We can assist!

Feel free to stay late to engage in our typical Rust discourse and ruminate on your favorite, or even least favorite, features and what you might make next!
